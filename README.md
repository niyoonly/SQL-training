# SQL-training

basically some practises I did on SQL using SQLite3, 
- accessing databses using Python API,
  I was using some connection and cursor methods ( .commit(), .execute(), .fetchall() , .fetchmany(), .cursor() , .commit() , .close() ,etc) to communicate with a very simple DB which i wrote just to see how the API worked
- accessing databses with SQL magic
  then I was trying the SQL magic ( line magics and cell magics) to see how to simplify SQL querying
  I also then loaded it using panda dataframe and later on creating a graph visualisation using seaborn which is based on matplotlib
